# IMPORTANT NOTE
# The following list of global attributes
# - contain the mandatory attributes necessary according to the CORDEX standard (see latest document on "CORDEX Arcive Desgin", March 2013
# - additional optional attributes "invented" by Hans-Juergen Panitz
#
# This control_ini file cannot be used together with that CCLM2CMOR tool version, which has been built to follow the CLM-Community suggestions
# for extended directory- and filenmae structures and extended list of global attributes for CMORization of data from a double-nest simulation
#
# By the way, the latest official version is that, which gives the possibilty to consider an additional sub-daily frequency, an implementation by Marie-Estelle
# This is important because the user has to take this into account in his CSV table (input from $DirConfig - see above); this table now must have 30 columns

#rcm_version_id: identifies reruns with perturbed parameters or smaller RCM release upgrades;...
#...differences between different rcm_version_id should be explained in the comments attribute or referred to in the source attribute
#rcm_version_id=fpsconv-x2yn2-v1
rcm_version_id=x0n1-v1

# rcm_nesting_information within "rcm_version_id": 
#  the contents of the mandatory attribute can be chosen freely.
#  here, we give an example for data from the Convections FPS, therefore the additionsl prefix "fpsconv"
#  The whole structure is according to agreements within the FPSC Community
#
#  Element describing the number of nesting levels (n)
#  and possible differences between simulation setups for different nesting levels which cannot be indicated otherwise (x2)
#  if such setup differences exist, this calls for extra flags, which is designated by a letter(s), being y,z,j or k
#  The reason for the extra flags associated with x2 is due to the possibility that a model team may
#  run more than one simulation with differences between nesting levels. In this case, without an extra
#  flag, the filenames would be the same and this is not permitted.
#
#  v signifies the version of the simulation. This can be changed in the event of a rerun with an
#  updated version of either the intermediate model or the cprcm
#
#  THE SPECIAL CASE OF DIRECT DOWNSCALING (1-nest approach) TO CP SCALES N.B.!
#   Use x0n1-v1. The nesting flag is self-explanatory while the x0 is maybe redundant but signifies
#   that the downscaling is direct from a GCM or Reanalysis product with no intermediate step.
#
#   SUMMARY OF NESTING INFORMATION
#   One nest:                                                   use x0n1-v1
#   Two nest, no differences in simulation setups of both runs: use x1n2-v1
#   Two nest, differences between setups:                       use x2yn2-v1
#   Two nest, additional differences between setups:            use x2yzn2-v1
